# For an artist to make prettier pictures, she requires..

# Feedback
 
![](/images/feedback.png)

She must be given instant feedback on request in order to eliminate dependence and delay between contributing and learning of its effect.

# and awareness

![](/images/awareness.png)

She must be kept informed of contributions made by peers in order to gain an understanding of her overarching goals.

# Which from a technical perspective, means..

# Automation

![](/images/automation.png)

A system must be capable of distilling contributions into sets of procedural instructions capable of being re-generated  by specialists in other areas of production.

# and monitoring

![](/images/monitoring.png)

A system must be capable of providing the means to distribute information either per request or via subscription.

# Both of which depend on..

# Uniformity

![](/images/uniformity.png)

A system must be capable of both producing and consuming intelligent content; metadata-rich content with which to keep a creation pipeline alive and responding well to change.

This includes publishing, filtering and archiving facilities.

# To accomplish any of the above, we must strive for..

# Platform agnosticism

A system cannot be bound by platform as she will choose the one most appropriate to her task.

# software

A system must facilitate for the multitude of software she will use to complete her task.

# language

A system must encompass the variety of programming languages and styles she will use.

# location

She will not depend on where the system is and so neither can the system depend on where she is.

# and scale

Finally, she is not alone. A system cannot be bound by her numbers and must remain responsive in any scenario.

# Using the following strategies..

# SOA

# DDD

# TDD

# Agile

# Lean

# And one mentality..

# Messaging

Like peer-to-peer messaging (email), it is asynchonous, language-independent and high-performant; a message-based system is loosely coupled and responds well to change.

We believe messaging is the perfect candidate to deliver all of the above.

# Implemented using..

# And finally delivered to you as either..

# On-premise

![](/images/on-premise.png)

Local, highly configurable and under your control.

# PaaS

![](/images/paas.png)

Best-of-both-worlds; configurable yet abstracts away low-level details and providing off-site services.

# SaaS

![](/images/saas.png)

A client-server relationship, fully encapsulated in your browser and accessible from any device.

# or IaaS

Providing both hardware and software, this will get your new studio up and running within minutes.
